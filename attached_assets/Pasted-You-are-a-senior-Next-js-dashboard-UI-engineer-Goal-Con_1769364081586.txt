You are a senior Next.js + dashboard UI engineer.

Goal:
Convert the Duralux Next.js dashboard template (App Router) into the Fellowship 360 dashboard UI.
This is UI + routing + navigation + layout + placeholder data only (NO real backend integration yet).
Keep the existing component patterns and pages as much as possible, but rename, reorganize, and repurpose them to match Fellowship 360.

Project facts:
- Repo is a Duralux admin template in Next.js 14 (App Router) located in src/app
- Uses Bootstrap + Sass
- We are rebranding everything to “Fellowship 360”
- Multi-tenant and DS Digital super-admin will exist later, but for this task we only need UI structure

Primary deliverable:
A working UI where the left sidebar, page titles, breadcrumbs, and route structure match the Fellowship 360 product modules.

--------------------------------------------
1) REBRAND (GLOBAL)
--------------------------------------------
Update ALL branding references:
- Replace the name “Duralux” with “Fellowship 360” in:
  - src/app/layout.js metadata title/description
  - sidebar/header labels
  - auth screens
  - any page headers / footer strings / HTML titles
- Replace favicon and logo assets (create placeholder Fellowship 360 logo if needed)
- Ensure browser tab title reads “Fellowship 360”

--------------------------------------------
2) ROUTE + NAV STRUCTURE (Fellowship 360)
--------------------------------------------
Create/rename routes in src/app to match the following module structure.
Use the existing page templates as starting points (don’t build from scratch if a similar page exists).

Required sidebar items (in this exact order):

A) Home
- /home (Dashboard overview: KPI cards, recent activity list)

B) People
- /people/contacts (table list)
- /people/contacts/[id] (profile view page)
- /people/segments (tags/segments UI)

C) Engage
- /engage/pipeline (Kanban workflow for visitor follow-up)
- /engage/tasks (task list)

D) Comms
- /comms/conversations (inbox style UI, can reuse chat/email patterns)
- /comms/broadcasts (broadcast message builder + history list)
- /comms/templates (template list)

E) Grace AI
- /grace/calls (call log table)
- /grace/calls/[id] (call detail: transcript, intent, outcome, notes)
- /grace/settings (forms/settings UI for agent config)

F) Prayer & Care
- /care/prayer-requests (board or table with status filters)
- /care/prayer-requests/[id] (detail view)

G) Scheduling
- /scheduling/calendar (calendar UI)
- /scheduling/appointments (table list)
- /scheduling/volunteers (volunteer schedule UI)

H) Giving
- /giving/donations (table)
- /giving/donors (donor list + donor profile)
- /giving/pledges (table)

I) Reports
- /reports/overview (summary dashboard)
- /reports/attendance (table + simple chart placeholder)
- /reports/engagement (simple placeholder score/report)

J) Settings
- /settings/church-profile (form UI)
- /settings/users-roles (table UI)
- /settings/integrations (cards UI)
- /settings/billing (placeholder UI)

K) DS Digital Admin (Super Admin UI only, no auth enforcement yet)
- /admin/churches (church list)
- /admin/churches/new (create church form)
- /admin/provisioning (provisioning status list)

--------------------------------------------
3) PAGE UI REQUIREMENTS (PLACEHOLDER DATA OK)
--------------------------------------------
For each major module, create a clean UI using Duralux’s existing patterns:
- Tables use existing Duralux table components/styles
- Detail pages have:
  - a header with title + action buttons
  - an “Overview” card
  - a “Details” section
  - a “Recent Activity” list section

Specific screens:

(1) /engage/pipeline
- Kanban with these columns:
  New Visitor
  Attempted
  Connected
  Scheduled Visit
  Joined
  Inactive
- Cards show: Name, last contact date, assigned owner, next action due date

(2) /grace/calls
- Table columns:
  Date/Time, Caller, Intent, Outcome, Duration, Follow-up Needed (Yes/No)
- Add filters at top: Intent, Outcome, Date range

(3) /grace/calls/[id]
- Show transcript block
- Show call metadata (intent/outcome/duration/sentiment placeholder)
- Show “Create Follow-up Task” button (UI only)

(4) /giving/donations
- Table columns:
  Date, Donor, Amount, Fund, Method, Status

(5) /people/contacts/[id]
- Profile card with name, phone, email, status (member/visitor/etc.)
- Timeline component (messages/calls/notes placeholders)

--------------------------------------------
4) SIDEBAR + HEADER CLEANUP
--------------------------------------------
- Remove irrelevant Duralux menu items (ecommerce, random apps not used)
- Make sure sidebar icons match the new labels (use existing icon set)
- Breadcrumbs should match the new route hierarchy

--------------------------------------------
5) CODE QUALITY / IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
--------------------------------------------
- Keep everything inside src/app (App Router)
- Use existing Duralux layout/providers — don’t break the theme
- Use placeholder arrays for data in each page (later we will connect Supabase)
- No TypeScript conversion required
- Ensure npm run dev works and navigation between pages is functional

--------------------------------------------
6) OUTPUT EXPECTATION
--------------------------------------------
When done, provide:
1) A list of files changed/created
2) Any new components created (and where)
3) Screenshots are not required, but the pages must compile and load

Proceed with implementation now.
